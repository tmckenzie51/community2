      <p> The Communtiy would love to get to know you more! Share with us what makes you
        excited, happy, your experiences, and what you look for in your Community. Not only
        will we find you a Community that matches you, but we'll also generate a list of
        great matches just for you!</p>

      <h2> Step Two: Create Your Community</h2>
        <p> You can create your own Community to find others who share your Community. At Community
          we know that you are a dynamic, multi-dimensional person. We recognize that even within
          groups that we identify ourselves with, that there are many other nuances of experiences,
          that make us all unique individuals with unique experiences. In keeping this in mind, we allow
          you to create as many communities as you'd like, within your broader communities.

      <h3> Step Three: Connect with Others In Your Community</h3>
      <p>After creating your Community you will receive a feed of matches, as well as be added to a storyboard
        where Community members share their own personal stories for provding inspiration, motivation and for putting
        a smile on your face. Feel free to add your story to the storyboard and be inspirared by the stories of others.
